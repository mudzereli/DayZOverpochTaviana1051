####Bug Fixes
- delete unused parachutes
- basic overwatch loot spawns added

####To Do
- throttle in safe zones (needs programming)
- gem trading (could possibly use my deploy mod for this)
- maintainence (i think this is set up but need to double check everything)
- single currency (needs lots of research/work)
